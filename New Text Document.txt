we want to make a comprehensive system containing cctv cameras, a computer maybe with the code and database(maybe a cloude based database like firebase) and a mobile application that are all connected together to create a system which can automatically collect the attendance of the students 

how will i connect the cctv(i dont know much about it or hardwares in general) to maybe another system which will be able to detect the faces of the people with a lot of accuracy even if the face of the person is not clearly visible on the scene the ai(i am thinking of using an api from the amazon rekognition which specilizes in the faces) to make this possible. I am also thinking to place the cctv camera inside the class room facing towards the students (basically it is in place of the teacher looking towards the student faces) which will make it more easier for the cctv camera to monitor the students. we can also factor in the time period the student was inside during the class period from when the class began and ended and maybe only then give the stident the attendance when he has been visible in the class period for at least 70% percent of the time. otherwise any student can just come inside the classroom show his/her face to the camera and leave getting the attendance even though he/she clearly had not attended the class. The possibilities can be endless as we can make the system stricter or looser when we can for maybe a duration where the students of a class are not atentive atall and are using phones or sitting at the back and sleeping in these senarios his face will be partially or not visible hence not granting him the attendance etc

Enroll students first (store their faces in Rekognition collection)., yes so for this we are thinking of crating a flutter application where the students can send their proper present time face pictures which will then be sent to the database from where it will be used in the amazon rekognition to know who the faces belong. the mobile app will have whats needed like account login, attendance percentage displayed for the stidents etc. but that will be designed later first we have to work on the present framework which we will be using
